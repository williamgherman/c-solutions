### Exercise 17.02

Write a function named `duplicate` that uses dynamic storage allocation to
create a copy of a string. For example, the call

```c
p = duplicate(str);
```

would allocate space for a string of the same length as `str`, copy the contents
of `str` into the new string, and return a pointer to it. Have `duplicate`
return a null pointer if the memory allocation fails.
