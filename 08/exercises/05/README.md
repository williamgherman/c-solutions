### Exercise 8.05
The Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..., where each number is the
sum of the two preceding numbers. Write a program fragment that declares an
array named `fib_numbers` of length 40 and fills the array with the first 40
Fibonacci numbers. *Hint*: Fill in the first two numbers individually, then use
a loop to compute the remaining numbers.

### Solution

```c
int i, fib_numbers[40] = {0, 1};

for (i = 2; i < (int) sizeof(fib_numbers) / sizeof(fib_numbers[0]); i++)
    fib_numbers[i] = fib_numbers[i-1] + fib_numbers[i-2];
```
