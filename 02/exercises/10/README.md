### Exercise 2.10
In the `dweight.c` program (Section 2.4), which spaces are essential?

### Solution
Below is the complete `dweight.c` program, as written in Section 2.4:

```c
/* Computes the dimensional weight of a 12" x 10" x 8" box */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int height, length, width, volume, weight;

    height = 8;
    length = 12;
    width = 10;
    volume = height * length * width;
    weight = (volume + 165) / 166;

    printf("Dimensions: %dx%dx%d\n", length, width, height);
    printf("Volume (cubic inches): %d\n", volume);
    printf("Dimensional weight (pounds): %d\n", weight);

    return 0;
}
```

The only necessary spaces are:

- the line break in the `#include` directive;
- the space between the `int` declaration and the main function;
- the space between the `int` declaration and the `height` variable;
- the space between `return` and `0`.

Indeed, without all "unnecessary" spaces the programme would be:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){int height,length,width,volume,weight;height=8;length=12;width=10;volume=height*length*width;weight=(volume+165)/166;printf("Dimensions: %dx%dx%d\n",length,width,height);printf("Volume (cubic inches): %d\n",volume);printf("Dimensional weight (pounds): %d\n",weight);return 0;}
```
