### Exercise 16.19

Declare a structure with the following members whose tag is `pinball_machine`:

`name` -- a string of up to 40 characters  
`year` -- an integer (representing the year of manufacture)  
`type` -- an enumeration with the values `EM` (electromechanical) and `SS`
(solid state)  
`players` -- an integer (representing the maximum number of players)

### Solution

```c
struct pinball_machine {
    char[40] name;
    int year;
    enum { EM, SS } type;
    int players;
};
```
struct pinball_machine {
    char name[40];
    unsigned int year;
    enum { EM, SS } type;
    unsigned int players;
};
