### Exercise 16.18

(a) Each square of a chessboard can hold one piece -- a pawn, knight, bishop,
rook, queen or king -- or it may be empty. Each piece is either black or white.
Define two enumerated types: `Piece`, which has seven possible values (one of
which is "empty"), and `Color`, which has two.

(b) Using the types from part (a), define a structure type named `Square` that
can store both the type of a piece and its color.

(c) Using the `Square` type from part (b), declare an 8 x 8 array named `board`
that can store the entire contents of a chessboard.

(d) Add an initializer to the declaration in part (c) so that `board`'s initial
value corresponds to the usual arrangement of pieces at the start of a chess
game. A square that's not occupied by a piece should have an "empty" piece value
and the color black.

### Solution

#### (a)

```c
typedef enum {EMPTY, PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN, KING} Piece;
typedef enum {BLACK, WHITE} Color;
```

#### (b)

```c
typedef struct { Piece; Color; } Square;
```

#### (c)

```c
Square[8][8] board;
```
//bugfix
Square board[8][8];

#### (d)

```c
Square[8][8] board = 
//bugfix


Square board[8][8]={
    {{ROOK,  WHITE}, {KNIGHT, WHITE}, {BISHOP, WHITE}, {QUEEN, WHITE},
     {KING,  WHITE}, {BISHOP, WHITE}, {KNIGHT, WHITE}, {ROOK,  WHITE}},
    {{PAWN,  WHITE}, {PAWN,   WHITE}, {PAWN,   WHITE}, {PAWN,  WHITE},
     {PAWN,  WHITE}, {PAWN,   WHITE}, {PAWN,   WHITE}, {PAWN,  WHITE}},
    {{EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},
     {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}},
    {{EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},
     {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}},
    {{EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},
     {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY,  BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}},
    {{PAWN,  BLACK}, {PAWN,   BLACK}, {PAWN,   BLACK}, {PAWN,  BLACK},
     {PAWN,  BLACK}, {PAWN,   BLACK}, {PAWN,   BLACK}, {PAWN,  BLACK}},
    {{ROOK,  BLACK}, {KNIGHT, BLACK}, {BISHOP, BLACK}, {QUEEN, BLACK},
     {KING,  BLACK}, {BISHOP, BLACK}, {KNIGHT, BLACK}, {ROOK,  BLACK}},
};
```
