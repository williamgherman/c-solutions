### Exercise 22.06

Write a call of `printf` that prints

```
1 widget
```

if the `widget` variable (of type `int`) has the value 1, and

*n* `widgets`

otherwise, where *n* is the value of `widget`. You are not allowed to use the
`if` statement or any other statement; the answer must be a single call of
`printf`.

### Solution

```c
printf("%d widget%s", widget, widget != 1 ? "s\n" : "\n");
```
### Another Solution
```
printf(widgets==1?"1 widgets":"%d widgets",widgets);
```
